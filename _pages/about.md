> Hi, this is Andy! I'm currently a 1st year grad student at [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/).

Blogs
======
Welcome! I'm putting my technical blog posts in this section. 
Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in any of them and have some questions.

Portfolio
======
In the portfolio page, you could find a curated collection of my work.
Like some on-going projects or interesting programs I'm participated in.

Free Writings
======
Just like it says, I keep this part seperate from the technical blogs. 
Feel free to dive in and explore. I would be happy if any of these "useless" thoughts could resonate with you.

Gallery
======
"i'm lovin' it" 
This is my favorate section. I'll showcase some visual work here, including photography, generated art, and etc. 

Courses
======
Here are some courses/tutorials I took and enjoyed with. Most of them would be about Data Science. 
I also provide my notes for some of them. 

Publications
======
My papers are here! (although it's an empty space now, lol)

About me/CV
======
Download my latest cv if interested.

One last note
======
Since I've linked my notion database to this website, you might be re-directed to a notion page sometimes.
(e.g. when clicking *Blogs* on the navigation bar) The advantage is that I can edit blogs and respond to comments with my mobile devices at any time. 
(whisper: actually the main reason is I'm tired coping with the annoying css format (๑´0`๑)
Therefore, please feel free to click "comment" to leave your words if you want to. 
Also, any feedback via email, social media is welcome!
