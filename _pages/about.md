> Hi, this is Andy! I'm currently a 3rd year grad student at [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/).

Publications
======
My papers are here!

Courses
======
Here are some courses/tutorials I took and enjoyed with. Most of them would be about Data Science. 
I also provide my notes for some of them. 

Free Writings
======
Just like it says, I keep this part seperate from the technical blogs. 
Feel free to dive in and explore. I would be happy if any of these "useless" thoughts could resonate with you.

Gallery
======
"i'm lovin' it" 
This is my favorate section. I'll showcase some visual work here, including photography, generated art, and etc.
